## Buzzers and speakers

Sound is just a movement in the air. Anything that causes the air to move can make a sound.

- Mechanical devices, usually work by striking two bits of metal together. A bell, for instance, will vibrate when it is hit, and cause the air around it to move.
- Electromechnical devices,  usually work by using electricity to move a coil of wire, that then causes a diaphragm to move very quickly and generate sound by moving the air around it.
- Piezoelectric devices, use the fact that some materials change size when a voltage is applied to them, and rapidly changing the voltage causes them to change size really quickly and move the air around it.

When a material moves very quickly, it produces higher pitched sounds.
When a material moves by a large amount, it produces louder sounds.

### Speakers and headphones

Speakers and headphones are electromechanical devices, and include a range of devices from the huge speakers you might find at a concert to the headphones you might wear in your ears.

To make a speaker work, you need to keep changing the voltage across the speaker. The faster you change the voltage (frequency), the higher pitched the sound will be. The greater the voltage (amplitude), the louder the sound will be.

Speakers and headphones can be connected using the headphone jack.

If you are using a speaker you need to tell it what frequency to vibrate at, to create the tone you want
### Buzzers

Buzzers, are normally, piezoelectric devices. A normal buzzer is called a **passive buzzer**. Like a speaker, the frequency of the change in voltage and the size of the voltage will change the pitch and volume.

If you are using a passive buzzer you need to tell it what frequency to vibrate at, to create the tone you want.

**Active buzzers** have additional components inside them so that they always use the same frequency. If you are using an active buzzer, you can only turn them on or off, and you can't change the tone. The passive buzzers are shown on the right hand side of the image above.
